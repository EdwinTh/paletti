Create your own colour palettes and apply them in `ggplot2` in a breeze. All you have to do is deliver the hex codes from you company or maybe derived from your favourite painting? Based on the great work by the [ochRe team](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ochRe).

Input is either a named `list` with `character` vectors containing hex codes, or a single `character` vector with hex colors.
